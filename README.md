This code simulates scientists exploring the scientific research space.

In the Run.py file, you can set the number of scientists, number of queries, dimensions of the search space, and weights for the different incentives of the scientists. Then, you can do a batch run with those parameters.

For each of the queries, the payoff values in the search space, or the "board", will be printed, along with the impact factor, years left in career, and citation count for each scientist.

There is also an animation generated from the plots made for each of the runs.

If more clarification is needed, feel free to contact the AMISTAD Lab at Harvey Mudd College.
