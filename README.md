## Simulating Science
# Purpose
This code simulates scientists exploring the scientific research space.

# Getting Started
In the Run.py file, you can set the number of scientists, number of queries, dimensions of the search space, and weights for the different incentives of the scientists. Then, you can do a batch run with those parameters.

For each of the queries, the payoff values in the search space, or the "board", will be printed, along with the impact factor, years left in career, and citation count for each scientist.

There is also an animation generated from the plots made for each of the runs.

To run the file, enter the following commands: 
Board = Board(x, y) #x and y are the rows and columns of the board, respectively
batchRun(board, a, b) #a is the number of Scientists on the board
#b is the number of “years” (runs) of the simulation
run Run.py
